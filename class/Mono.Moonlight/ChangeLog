	* Mono/NativeMethods.cs: Add new methods. 

2008-05-07  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Sign the assembly, without delay, using Mono's key.

2008-05-04  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Mono/XapHack.cs: Another hack for creating MarshalByRefObjects.

	We should probably eliminate the need for this, and just have a
	dedicated mechanism that can pass an array of strings on a
	cross-domain call (the only interaction we ever need to make,
	which we are not even doing now).

	* Mono/NativeMethods.cs: Add more native methods. 

2008-04-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* System.Windows.Interop/PluginHost.cs: Add methods to track the
	surface as well.

	* NativeMethods.cs: reamed referece to collection_count to 
	collection_get_count
