	* ItemsControl.cs: access the Property not the member to avoid a
	crash.

2009-05-13  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ContentPresenter.cs: Measure needs to be invalidated every
	  time the Content or ContentTemplate changes, not just when
	  we alter the root visual.

2009-05-12  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ItemsControl.cs: ItemsControl has the same behaviour as
	  ContentPresenter - the DataContext property is only set if
	  the item is *not* a framework element.

2009-05-12  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ContentPresenter.cs: ContentPresenter copies Content to
	  DataContext iff the Content is not a FrameworkElement.

2009-05-12  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* TextBox.cs (OnCursorPositionChanged): Fixed scrolling to behave
	more normally. Might still need some work, but at least it's no
	longer painful. I'm sure toshok will be appreciative ;-)

2009-05-12  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ItemsControl.cs:
	* ItemCollection.cs: The ItemsCollection should be
	  instantiated once and reused even when the ItemsSource
	  changes. When ItemsSource is non-null, we don't propagate
	  collection changed events.

2009-05-11  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ContentPresenter.cs: Whenever the content root is changed,
	  we need to invalidate the measure so that the presenter
	  refreshes properly.

2009-05-11  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ContentPresenter.cs: Recommit r133738 as it's not causing
	  the timeouts.

2009-05-11  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ContentPresenter.cs: Recommit r133724/5 as it isn't causing
	  the timeouts.

2009-05-11  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ItemsControl.cs:
	* ContentPresenter.cs: When a container is autogenerated, we
	  copy the Content to the DataContext.

2009-05-11  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ContentPresenter.cs: Back out r133724/5 in case it's what
	  has caused the random failures in the extended controls
	  tests.

2009-05-08  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ContentPresenter.cs: Revert the changes in r133738 until I
	  can figure out why the x86 bot doesn't like them. It's
	  causing the extended controls tests to time out.

2009-05-08  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ContentPresenter.cs: That debug spew wasn't supposed to hit
	  SVN

2009-05-07  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ContentPresenter.cs: If the content property changes, the
	  Template is cleared if it has already been applied.

2009-05-07  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ItemsPresenter.cs: ItemsPresenter should be hooking itself
	  in during the first MeasureOverride as opposed to when it's
	  loaded. This matches the MS behaviour.

2009-05-07  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ContentPresenter.cs: I seem to have mangled that last patch
	  before committing - fix the build.

2009-05-07  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ContentPresenter.cs: 1) The 'Content' property of the
	  ContentPresenter is not copied to DataContext.
	2) If the expanded DataTemplate is null, fall back to
	  displaying the Content.

2009-05-03  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ContentControl.cs (WalkTreeForContentPresenters): not sure why
	we passed "this" to this method.  Just use this instead of
	templateRoot.  Also, use a more verbose TemplateBindingExpression
	initialization.

2009-05-01  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ContentControl.cs: If the default ContentPresenter is
	  replaced in a ContentControl, we need to TemplateBind both
	  the Content and ContentTemplate.

2009-04-28  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ItemsControl.cs: Ensure that PrepareContainerForItemOverride
	  is handling both ContentControls and ContentPresenters
	  correctly.

2009-04-28  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Copy over the styles/templates to the items
	  from the ComboBox.
	Clicking the ToggleButton should open the dropdown.
	When a ComboBoxItem is autogenerated, we need to store the
	  autogenerated box in DisplayedItem so that we can put its
	  content back later on.

	* ItemsControl.cs: Generate the container only when it's
	  required. When the container is a ContentControl, ensure
	  that the container doesn't try to set the items logical
	  parent.

2009-04-28  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ComboBoxItem.cs: MouseUp should result in the popup being
	  closed but the selection is not changed.

2009-04-28  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ContentControl.cs: Add the ability to stop ContentControl
	  from automatically setting the LogicalParent when a
	  FrameworkElement is added as the Content.

2009-04-24  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Ensure that the currently selected item is
	  displayed correctly when the popup is not open.

2009-04-23  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Clicking on ListItems in the combobox popup
	  should close the popup.

2009-04-23  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Allow popups to use a transparent canvas to
	  catch clicks outside of the popup area. ComboBox uses this
	  to close its popup.

2009-04-23  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ComboBoxItem.cs: Removing unnecessary override

2009-04-23  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Move the Notify* methods into Selector as both
	  Listbox and ComboBox require the same API.

2009-04-23  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ItemsControl.cs: FrameworkElements added to an
	  ItemsCollection need to have their logical parent set to the
	  ItemsControl.

2009-04-22  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Add missing nullcheck around access to a
	  templated part.

2009-04-22  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: ComboBox should return a new ComboBoxItem
	  without applying the container style.

2009-04-22  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ItemsPresenter.cs: After some extensive testing in
	  silverlight, I think this change is correct. When templating
	  ComboBox, the Popup used to display the items has no visual
	  parent but does have a logical parent. Therefore the only
	  way to connect the ItemsPresenter to the ItemsControl is to
	  fall back to the logical parent when the VisualParent is
	  null. I'm not sure if this is popup specific behaviour or if
	  this is true for all controls which have a null visual
	  parent but non-null logical parent.

2009-04-17  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: Make IsSelectionActive work. Also make showing
	  the popup work. Currently no items are being displayed in
	  the popup as the ItemsPresenter is never getting loaded.

2009-04-17  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* SaveFileDialog.cs: Implement DefaultExtbehavior

2009-04-15  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ItemsControl.cs: When an ItemsControl is templated, don't
	  replace the templated visual tree with the ItemsPresenters
	  visual tree.

	* ItemsPresenter.cs: ItemsPresenter should search the visual
	  tree, not logical tree, when trying to find its ItemsControl

2009-04-14  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* OpenFileDialog.cs:
	* SaveFileDialog.cs: Generate all P/Invoke methods.

2009-04-13  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* ClickMode.cs:
	* generic.xaml:
	* Orientation.cs:
	* ProgressBar.cs: Delete files we got from MS' controls drop,
	  and update project file to compile.

2009-04-09  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* PasswordBox.cs, TextBlock.cs, TextBox.cs: Removed manual stub
	for FontSource property, these are now autogenerated.

2009-04-09  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* OpenFileDialog.cs: Free the memory we receive from 
	open_file_dialog_show
	* SaveFileDialog.cs: New. Silverlight 3 feature

2009-04-08  Stephane Delcroix  <sdelcroix@novell.com>

	* MultiScaleImage.cs: no longer throws NIE on LogicalToElementPoint

2009-04-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ContentPresenter.cs: turns out my layout fears were unfounded.
	Removing the grid will give us the same layout characteristics as
	silverlight.  Alan was right about the different visual tree under
	CP.  Duplicate this tree so that it matches SL in all 3 cases: 1)
	UIElement content (directly a child of contentpresenter), 2)
	string content (grid -> textblock), and 3) no content (no children
	under contentpresenter.)  This simplifies PrepareContentPresenter
	quite a bit.

2009-04-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (set_DefaultStyleKey): add a few more error
	conditions (surrounding UserControlType) to get 2.0 ms test
	fixture 552 closer to working.

2009-04-06  Stephane Delcroix  <sdelcroix@novell.com>

	* MultiScaleImage.cs: lookup the new DPs and new properties

2009-04-03  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* TextBox.cs: TextBox does validation in both the getter and
	  setter of its TextProperty, so we have to manually implement
	  it.

2009-04-02  Aaron Bockover  <abockover@novell.com>

	* ContentPresenter.cs: Nuke a BOM on which gmcs 2.0.1 explodes

2009-03-30  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: track change of MouseButton -> MouseLeftButton, and
	add MouseRightButtonUp/Down and MouseWheel.


2009-03-27  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ItemsControl.cs: only install our default ItemsPresenter if
	there isn't a template that's going to be applied to this element.
	In the case of a template either 1 of 2 things will happen.
	Either there's an ItemsPresenter someplace in the template, and
	ItemsPresenter.InvokeLoaded grovels up the tree until it finds
	this ItemsControl, calling SetItemsPresenter on it, or the control
	deals with all the Items changes manually (as in TabControl) and
	we never have an ItemsPresenter.

2009-03-27  Stephane Delcroix  <sdelcroix@novell.com>

	* MultiScaleImage.cs: MotionFinished is a RoutedEvent

2009-03-26  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* PasswordBox.cs: We no longer do the evil gross hackery action.

	* TextBox.cs: Updated NativeMethods use for text_box_base

2009-03-25  Stephane Delcroix  <sdelcroix@novell.com>

	* MultiScaleImage.cs: ViewportChanged is a RoutedEvent

2009-03-23  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* TextBox.cs: Connect to our CursorPositionChanged event so we can
	update the scrollviewer offsets.

2009-03-18  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Use NativeMethods.control_focus() instead of
	NativeMethods.surface_focus_element().

2009-03-17  Jb Evain  <jbevain@novell.com>

	* Grid.cs: override and seal ArrangeOverride and MeasureOverride.

2009-03-10  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* PasswordBox.cs: Manually bind the PasswordProperty and the
	getter/setter. Don't allow the Password getter to return null.

2009-03-10  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* PasswordBox.cs: Connect to TextChanged instead of
	PasswordChanged events on the unmanaged side, since the unmanaged
	code subclasses TextBox we'll just reuse the same event. Also, map
	SelectionBackground and SelectionForeground properties to the
	TextBox properties manually.

2009-03-09  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* TextBox.cs: Use ObjectFromIntPtr instead of GCHandle. Doh.

2009-03-06  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* ContentControl.cs, Image.cs, MediaElement.cs,
	  MultiScaleImage.cs, PasswordBox.cs,
	  TextBox.cs: Switch to using ObjectFromIntPtr to lookup objects.

2009-03-04  Stephane Delcroix  <sdelcroix@novell.com>

	* MultiScaleImage.cs: use the native setters instead of the
	SetValue for ViewportOrigin and Width

2009-02-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ItemsControl.cs: land some longstanding local changes.

	* ItemsPresenter.cs: same.

2009-02-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ContentControl.cs (InvokeOnApplyTemplate): override
	FrameworkElement's implementation so we can walk our visual
	subtree calling OnApplyTemplate and add the default
	TemplateBinding for ContentPresenter.ContentProperty (if there
	isn't one already) on all ContentPresenters that are our
	descendents (without an intervening control.)

2009-02-18  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* MediaElement.cs: Initial implementation of
	  MediaStreamSource.

2009-02-18  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* TextBox.cs: There are no HitTest methods on TextBox in the
	  SL 2.0 api

2009-02-13  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* MultiScaleImage.cs: Manually bind the DependencyProperties and
	the property accessors.

2009-02-12  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ItemCollection.cs: Managed objects are stored in native as
	  GCHandles. Use the mono api to get the target of that
	  GCHandle so that they can be compared correctly in
	  value.cpp. Remove hack in ItemCollection.cs which worked
	  around this bug.

2009-02-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ItemsControl.cs (PrepareContainerForItemOverride): if
	DisplayMemberPath is set, create a binding and hook it up to the
	content presenter's ContentProperty.

2009-02-08  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* TextBlock.cs: Implement OnCreateAutomationPeer

2009-02-06  Larry Ewing  <lewing@novell.com>

	* ContentPresenter.cs: don't compare against _elementText compare
	against null.

2009-02-05  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ItemsControl.cs: implement basic databinding support - no
	templates, no DisplayMemberPath, just a databound ItemsSource with
	INotifyCollectionChanged handling.

	* ItemCollection.cs: add SetReadOnly so ItemsControl can mark the
	collection as readonly (only for the user, the collection remains
	modifiable by the control).

2009-02-05  Larry Ewing  <lewing@novell.com>

	* StackPanel.cs: skip collapsed children.

2009-02-05  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* MultiScaleImage.cs: We hide the SubImages in a internal DP for now
	until we can automatically generated a ReadOnlyCollection from 	
	a native counterpart in the generator.

2009-02-05  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* MultiScaleSubImageCollection.cs: Managed counterpart to the native
	collection.

2009-02-04  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* TextBlock.cs: Change the NotImplementedException into a MonoTODO
	to get Tetrislite go further

2009-02-04  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ItemsControl.cs: flesh out some of the implementation in the
	non-databound scenario (using the Items collection).

	* ItemsPresenter.cs: create a stackpanel for the time being, since
	that seems to be what the default behavior is.

	* ComboBox.cs: flesh out the implementation and fix up the
	gui-compare.

	* ComboBoxItem.cs: gui-compare stuff.

2009-02-04  Larry Ewing  <lewing@novell.com>

	* StackPanel.cs: remove the restriction on size of the visible
	children it breaks since that uses a rendertransform to make
	things visible again.

2009-02-04  Larry Ewing  <lewing@novell.com>

	* StackPanel.cs: rework the alignment logic to match some of the
	new tests.

2009-02-04  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* HitTestCollection.cs: Hook up the managed hittesting code
	  to the native hit testing code.

2009-02-02  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* UserControl.cs: remove the ContentProperty attribute - we
	autogenerate it now

	* Border.cs: same.

2009-02-02  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ComboBox.cs: set DefaultStyleKey in the ctor to pick up the
	right template.

2009-01-30  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (Initialize): register empty delegates on all the
	events we expose in the form of On$Event methods, so our methods
	are called.

2009-01-30  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* TextBox.cs: Fixed SelectionChanged

2009-01-30  Larry Ewing  <lewing@novell.com>

	* StackPanel.cs: only use the alignment logic if the dimentions
	aren't specified.

2009-01-29  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* ItemCollection.cs: Override IndexOfImpl so we can compare
	objects in the managed side.

2009-01-26  Larry Ewing  <lewing@novell.com>

	* StackPanel.cs: improve the logic and add horizontal support.

2009-01-26  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* ContentControl.cs (content_changed_callback): Fixed cast
	exception for the event args.

	* TextBox.cs (text_changed_cb): Fixed some cast exceptions and
	also pass our EventArgs to InvokeTextChanged().

2009-01-26  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* Control.cs: Surface lives in Deployment now.

2009-01-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ContentPresenter.cs (PrepareContentPresenter): call
	uielement_set_subtree_object here to hook the _elementRoot into
	the visual tree.
	
2009-01-25  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ContentPresenter.cs: move the 90% implementation back here.

	* Control.cs: don't register the DefaultStyleKey property - the
	unmanaged code already does it.  Just look it up here.

2009-01-22  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* ContentPresenter.cs: Simplified by ripping out most of the code
	that was moved to c++.

	* ContentControl.cs: Simplified a lot by re-using the Events class
	helper functions.

	* ContentPresenter.cs: New binding to unmanaged ContentPresenter
	class. Replaces the old ContentPresenetr class from the Microsoft
	Silverlight b1 sources.

2009-01-21  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* Image.cs: Clean up stuff that should (and now is) have been 
	generated.

2009-01-21  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* ContentControl.cs: Connect to the internal ContentChanged event
	so that we can call the virtual OnContentChanged() method.

2009-01-20  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: we no longer need to override InvokeLoaded - the
	style process is driven in unmanaged code.  Also clean up the
	handling of DefaultStyleKey - we can't throw an exception in the
	changed handler.  it has to be thrown before the value is changed.
	Get rid of the change handler.

	* TextBox.cs: get rid of the Initialize method.
	
2009-03-15  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Image.cs:
	* TextBox.cs:
	* Control.cs:
	* PasswordBox.cs:
	* MediaElement.cs:
	* MultiScaleImage.cs: Simplify how native events are connected to in
	managed code. The managed add/remove event methods just call
	RegisterEvent/UnregisterEvent defined in DO.cs instead of each event
	managing the event list itself.

2009-01-19  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Image.cs:
	* TextBox.cs:
	* PasswordBox.cs:
	* MediaElement.cs:
	* MultiScaleImage.cs: Change all our native callbacks to use a wrapped
	handler which traps managed exceptions.

2009-01-18  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* MediaElement.cs: These are RoutedEventHandlers, not EventHandlers.
	Fixes a InvalidCastException with PDC.

2009-01-16  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* TextBox.cs (ArrangeOverride): Removed.

2009-01-15  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* MediaElement.cs: Tiny little beginning of MediaStreamSource and remove
	a few members which can be generated now that the native MediaElement
	doesn't inherit from MediaBase anymore.

2009-01-15  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ComboBox.cs:
	* ComboBoxItem.cs: Begin implementing ComboBox. First 3 tests now pass.

2009-01-15  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* ItemCollection.cs: Override NullCheck to throw ArgumentExpcetion
	for all null values (instead of the default ArgumentNullException
	on _some_ null values).

2009-01-13  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* StackPanel.cs: Seal overrides to please gui-compare

2009-01-12  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* TextBlock.cs:
	* MultiScaleImage.cs: Corcompare issues.

2009-01-12  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* StackPanel.cs: New managed implementation (only vertical
 	  orientation)

2009-01-09  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* ItemsControl.cs: Implemented a bit more

2009-01-08  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* ItemsControl.cs: Partial implementation (enough to pass some 
	controls unit tests)

2009-01-08  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* ItemCollection.cs: Change to partial class

2009-01-07  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs (Control.InvokeLoaded): get the default style for the
	control if it has a DefaultStyleKey.  We don't do anything with it
	yet, but this process drives the parsing of generic.xaml.

2009-01-06  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* PasswordBox.cs: Ensure correct exception is thrown when a null string
	is passed to PasswordBox.Password. Use correct range validation for
	MaxLength.

2008-12-19  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* PasswordBox.cs, ItemsPresenter.cs: More bits.
	* CalendarMode.cs: Deleted, this file goes in
	  System.Windows.Controls.dll.

2008-12-19  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Remove OnIsEnabled hack for needed by beta1 controls.

2008-12-19  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* CalendarMode.cs, ComboBox.cs, ComboBoxItem.cs: Stub out and fill in
	  more bits to get even more bits compiling.

2008-12-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: add Initialize method to add a handler for the
	TemplateApplied unmanaged event.  Call
	FrameworkElement.OnApplyTemplate from there.

2008-12-11  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: implement GetTemplateChild.

2008-12-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* PasswordBox.cs: Stub out to fix build.

2008-12-10  Full Name  <Email Address>

	* TextBox.cs: Commit the files from the generator.

2008-12-10  Full Name  <Email Address>

	* TextBox.cs:
	* PasswordBox.cs: Partial implementation of the PasswordBox control

2008-12-09  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* UserControl.cs: Remove IsTabStop initialization (moved to 
	unmanaged code)

2008-12-08  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* UserControl.cs: Add Initialize and set IsTabStop to false

2008-12-08  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Control.cs: Add null check on EventArgs for all On* methods.
	Check Handled (when provided) before making the calls to On*.
	Re-use internal 'events' for IsEnabledChanged

2008-12-05  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>
