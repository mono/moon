DO NOT MANUALLY EDIT THE .info FILES

See the ../Descriptors/*.xml files to let the tuner include more, 
internalized, types/methods into Moonlight assemblies.


Update instructions
-------------------

Use the mono-api-info.exe (from /mcs/tools/corcompare) to generate .info 
files from Silverlight assemblies. E.g. 

mono mono-api-info.exe $SL/System.Core.dll > System.Core.info

Note that System.Windows.dll and System.Windows.Browser.dll are not tuned,
like other mcs-based assemblies, so those .info files are not needed.
