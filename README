This is Moonlight, an open source implementation of Silverlight 1.0, 2.0
and 3.0 for Unix systems.   

See http://www.mono-project.com/Moonlight for more information. 

Installation
============

	For standard Unix configuration/installation instructions, see the INSTALL file.

Requirements
============

	At this time, Moonlight trunk (this release) requires you to use
	Mono trunk. To build Moonlight, you need to get the mono and
	mono-basic repositories from a specific revision from trunk.

	Do this like this:
            git clone git://github.com/mono/moon.git moon
            git clone git://github.com/mono/mono.git mono
            cd mono && git reset --hard 5f78cb8 && cd ..
            git clone git://github.com/mono/mono-basic.git mono-basic
            cd mono-basic && git reset --hard HEAD && cd ..

	To build pixel shader support, you need to get a specific
	revision of the mesa repository.

	Do this like this:
            git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa
            cd mesa && git reset --hard 3ed0a099c && cd ..


Compiling Mono for Moonlight
============================

	Automatic Mode (recommended)
	==============

	This is recommended if you haven't built Mono before. This is also recommended if you
	have clean mono and mcs checkouts that you are going to use just for Moonlight.

	In this mode, you don't have to build Mono before building Moonlight, so you just do

                cd moon
                ./autogen.sh
                make && make install


	This will configure your Mono source tree with the minimum options required
	to build it for Moonlight. At the moment, these are:

		--with-moonlight=only --with-profile4=no --enable-minimal=aot,interpreter
		--with-ikvm-native=no --with-mcs-docs=no --disable-nls --disable-mono-debugger
		--with-sgen=no

	This Mono configuration will not be suitable for anything except Moonlight.


	Build only Mode (advanced)
	==========================

	This is recommended if you have built Mono before and you would like Moonlight to use
	your existing Mono source tree. This is for advanced users only - make sure you know
	what you're doing.

	In this mode, Moonlight will not touch your existing Mono configuration, it will build
	the parts it needs. Since it doesn't do a full build of mono+mcs, it's faster than a
	normal mono+mcs build.

	Before building moon, you need to make sure your mono configuration includes the
	following options:

		--with-moonlight=yes

	To build moon in this mode, configure it with the following options:

		--with-manual-mono=build


	Manual Mode (really advanced)
	=============================

	On this mode, moon will not configure or build mono, you have to do it yourself.
	To activate this mode, configure moon with --with-manual-mono=yes



Configuration options
=====================

	If your mono/mcs checkout is not in the same place where you have your moon
	source, you can configure moon with:

		--with-mcs-path=/path/to/mcs


	If you want to use ffmpeg with Moonlight, you need at least r20911 of ffmpeg and r30099 of libswscale:

		svn co -r 20911 svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg/trunk && cd trunk/libswscale && svn up -r 30099

Installing and Testing
======================

	If you want to test your newly installed Moonlight, do this:

		make test-plugin

	This will install it into your ~/.mozilla/plugins which will let
	both Firefox and Chrome pick it.


Runtime Options
===============

	There are a couple of runtime-parameters that affect Moonlight behavior
	and turn on/off certain features. Those options are specified through
	the MOONLIGHT_OVERRIDES env variable. The more interesting ones are:

	* shapecache=yes/no 

		Use some extra memory for caching shapes.  Increases
		memory usage but helps with performance (off by
		default). The shape cache size is 6MB max.

	* render=ftb/btf

		Use front-to-back or back-to-front rendering (ftb is
 		the default).

	* cache=show/hide 

		Show the (shape) cache usage statistics. In plugin
		mode they're available through the right-click popup
		menu (hide by default). 

	* converter=yuv/ffmpeg 

		Use native mmx/sse2 conversion code or ffmpeg to do
		the yuv -> rgb colorspace conversion (by default we
		use the native yuv code).

	To launch Firefox with shape caching and ffmpeg converters use:

		$> MOONLIGHT_OVERRIDES="shapecache=yes,converter=ffmpeg" firefox


	Other options include:

	* ms-codecs=yes/no
	* ffmpeg-codecs=yes/no

		Controls which sets of codecs to use, the Microsoft
		ones or the ffmpeg ones.

	* timesource=manual/system

		Defaults to `system'.   


	Also if --with-debug=yes option was provided to configure script, the
	MOONLIGHT_DEBUG env variable controls which debug output is printed
	on the console. Valid values are: 

        	alsa, alsa-ex, audio, audio-ex, pulse, pulse-ex, httpstreaming, 
        	markers, markers-ex, mms, mediaplayer, mediaplayer-ex, pipeline, 
        	pipeline-error, framereaderloop, ui, ffmpeg, codecs, dependencyobject, 
        	downloader, font, layout, media, mediaelement, mediaelement-ex, 
        	buffering, asf, playlist, playlist-warn, text, xaml


	Moonlight currently contains two ASX parsers. The default
	parser is a custom parser that accounts for some of ASX's
	oddities such as quotes in attribute strings and non case
	sensitive element names (ie <foo></FOO>). The older parser
	uses a true xml parser, so will not handle these oddities
	well, however it has been more heavily tested. To use the
	older expat based playlist parser set the env variable
	MOONLIGHT_USE_EXPAT_ASXPARSER=1.

	There are two XAML parsers available in Moonlight. An
	unmanaged one that is used for Silverlight 1, 2 and 3
	applications and a managed one that is used for silverlight 4
	(and above) applications.  The parser is determined at runtime
	after the app manifest is read.  The unmanaged parser is
	always used to parse the app manifest.  After that the correct
	parser is determined based on Deployment::RuntimeVersion.

	You can force moonlight to use the managed parser on all sites
	by setting the MOON_USE_MANAGED_XAML_PARSER environment
	variable.

	You can force moonlight to use the unmanaged parser on all
	sites by setting the MOON_DONT_USE_MANAGED_XAML_PARSER
	environment variable.


Licensing
=========

	The C and C++ code that makes up the engine is dual-licensed
	under the LGPL v2 license and is also available commercially
	for developers interested in using Moonlight on embedded
	systems or other systems where the end-user can not upgrade
	the LGPL code on his own.

	The C# tests in test/2.0/Microsoft.Silverlight.Testing are
	copyrighted by Microsoft and released by them under the 
	open source MS-PL license.
	
	The C# controls in class/Microsoft.SilverlightControls/ and
	class/WPF.Toolkit are copyrighted by Microsoft and released by
	them under the open source MS-PL license.


Technical Details
=================

	For implementation details and notes, see the NOTES file.


Test Suite
==========

	To run the test suite, make sure that the output from
	configure indicates that the tests will be run.  Once this is
	done, you can run the tests like this:

	To run the Moonlight Unit Tests:

		cd moon/test/2.0/moon-unit
		make test
		

Firefox 3
=========

	The original Silverlight.js shipped by Microsoft was incompatible
	with Firefox 3.  We have released a greasemonkey script 
	(data/silverlight-ff3-quirks.user.js) that will patch this behaviour
	for some sites.
