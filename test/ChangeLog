	* xaml/drtlist.xml:

	images.

2007-10-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* harness/xaml2png.cpp (main): use RUNTIME_INIT_AUDIO_DISABLE so

	args, and use the manual time source to move the timemanager to
	those times before dumping pngs.

2007-10-17  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* harness/Makefile.am (xaml2png_LDADD): add MOON_PROG_LIBS.
