	* Makefile.am: Use MOON_PLUGIN_DIR to override the path to libmoonplugin

2008-04-11  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* xaml/clock/README.txt:
	* xaml/clock/clock32.xaml: Adding a test-case that showcases the
	jagyness/align problem in our storyboards/clocks. Esentially we never
	"Tick" at the edge value on stop.

2008-04-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* xaml/test-directory-in-zip.html: Fix test to work on SL as well.

2008-04-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* xaml/test-downloader-aborted-in-setsource.html,
	  xaml/test-downloader-aborted-in-setsource.xaml,
	  xaml/test-setsource-with-downloader.html,
	  xaml/test-setsource-with-downloader.xaml: Renamed to something more
	  meaningful.
	* xaml/drtlist.xml: Added test-setsource-with-downloader.

2008-04-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* xaml/test-downloader-aborted-in-setsource.html,
	  xaml/test-downloader-aborted-in-setsource.xaml: Minor fixes.

2008-04-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* xaml/test-downloader-aborted-in-setsource.html,
	  xaml/test-downloader-aborted-in-setsource.xaml: Added.

2008-04-10  Andrew Jorgensen  <ajorgensen@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am: Set MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH and LD_LIBARY_PATH so that tests will
	use the uninstalled plugin

2008-04-07  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* harness/masters/test-shape-path-stretch-gradientMaster.png:
	* xaml/drtlist.xml:
	* xaml/test-shape-path-stretch-gradient.xaml: One more test for path
	stretching and gradients.

2008-04-07  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* harness/masters/test-shape-line-stretch-gradientMaster.png:
	* xaml/drtlist.xml:
	* xaml/test-shape-line-stretch-gradient.xaml: One more test for line
	stetching and gradients. Gradients work correctly but fails because of
	stetching borkeness (see test-shape-line-stretch3.xaml).

2008-04-07  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* harness/masters/test-shape-line-stretch3Master.png:
	* xaml/drtlist.xml:
	* xaml/test-shape-line-stretch3.xaml: Adding new test for line
	stretching. This is similiar to the test-shape-path-strech4.xaml except
	that it uses actual Line object instead of path. Fails for exactly
	similiar reasons -- stretching the bounds including stroke instead of
	using the logical extents.

2008-04-02  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* xaml/drtlist.xml:
	* xaml/test-shape-path-stretch4.xaml: Adding one more path stretching
	test (+Master) that is currently broken. This one shows how the stroke
	size deforms our Stretch fill calculations.

2008-03-31  Andrew Jorgensen  <ajorgensen@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am, harness/Makefile.am: Add directories to dist for tests

2008-03-31  Larry Ewing  <lewing@novell.com>

	* xaml/drtlist.xml: convert some of the tests that were
	incorrectly turned into animations back to static tests.  Fix the
	incorrect html templates for those tests.

2008-03-28  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* xaml/clock/README.txt: Updating the test descriptions. 
	
	Removing the notes about failures on Windows (I couldn't reproduce them
	with latest SL). 

	Adding information about the new tests added.

2008-03-28  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* xaml/clock/clock31.html:
	* xaml/clock/clock31.xaml: One more clock test with duration-base
	RepeatBehavior and AutoReverse property specified. Fails currently.

2008-03-28  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* xaml/clock/clock30.html:
	* xaml/clock/clock30.xaml: Adding a new clock test that has
	AutoReverse="True" set on Storyboard (not animation). It currently keeps
	repeating forever, while it should repeat only once.

2008-03-28  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* xaml/clock/clock26.xaml: Updating this test's description. It actually
	passes now (the behavior is same on SL).

2008-03-26  Stephane Delcroix  <sdelcroix@novell.com>

	* xaml/test-shape-dashcaps.xaml: new test.

2008-03-26  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* harness/masters/test-shape-path-stretch3Master.png:
	* xaml/drtlist.xml:
	* xaml/test-shape-path-stretch3.xaml: Yet another test for shape/path
	bounds brokeness with Stretch=Fill.

2008-03-26  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* harness/masters/test-shape-path-stretch2Master.png:
	* xaml/drtlist.xml:
	* xaml/test-shape-path-stretch2.xaml: Adding one extra test that shows
	our stretching bug. It look like we're missing or adding extra
	translation (the line should be at y = 10). Master included.

2008-03-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* xaml/drtlist.xml:	
	* xaml/test-custom-namespace.xaml: Remove this test, since it
	requires external dependencies that we don't have and doesn't even
	test what it is supposed to test.

2008-03-25  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* test/harness/masters/test-shape-path-stretchMaster.png:
	* test/xaml/drtlist.xml:
	* test/xaml/test-shape-path-stretch.xaml: Renaming the test since it
	actually tests path stretching.

2008-03-25  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* test/harness/masters/test-stroke-low-thicknessMaster.png:
	* test/xaml/drtlist.xml:
	* test/xaml/test-stroke-low-thickness.xaml: Adding a test that showcases
	differences in ML <-> SL low-width stroke rendering. Master included.

	* test/xaml/drtlist.xml:
	* test/xaml/test-shape-line-stretch3.xaml: Adding one more (currently
	failing) test against line stretching. Take from the Silverlight
	showcase. Master included.

2008-03-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* xaml/drtlist.xml:
	* xaml/test-parser-multiple-canvases: Add a new test that checks
	for setting a name multiple times.

2008-03-24  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* test/harness/masters/test-lineargradientbrush-absolute-moireMaster.png:
	* test/harness/masters/test-lineargradientbrush-moire-scaledMaster.png:
	* test/harness/masters/test-radialgradientbrush-absolute-moireMaster.png:
	Adding some masters for subpixel-gradient rendering tests.

2008-03-24  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* test/harness/masters/test-blending-gradientsMaster.png:
	* test/xaml/drtlist.xml:
	* test/xaml/test-blending-gradients.xaml: Adding a new test that does
	some alpha blending on gradients with SL master. Shows an interesting SL

	* test/xaml/test-text-font-sizing-vs-hinting.xaml: Adding a test for
	scaling text and checking how it goes with hinting. It should not be too
	jumpy. 

	Master needed.

	* test/xaml/arial-pango.png:
	* test/xaml/drtlist.xml:
	* test/xaml/test-text-font-quality.xaml:
	* test/xaml/times-pango.png:
	* test/xaml/verdana-pango.png: Adding a new test against our crappy
	small-fonts rendering quality. Compares side-by-side with Pango
	rendering masters for Arial, Verdana and Times New Roman.

2008-03-19  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* test/xaml/drtlist.xml:
	* test/xaml/test-crash-gracefull-prop-resolving.xaml: Yet another
	property-resolving test-case. This time we check against a human error
	which we could be smart about (reported on http://sessions.visitmix.com).

2008-03-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* xaml/drtlist.xml: Add codebehind files.

	Master needed.

2008-03-15  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* xaml/test-mediaelement-clip.xaml, xaml/test-videobrush.xaml,

	animations. Not yet added to the drtlist.

2008-03-06  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* xaml/test-storyboard-simple-autoreverse-forever.xaml:

	* index.aspx:
	* xamlize.aspx:
	* Silverlight.js: A few helper asp.net pages to test all our tests in here
	in browser.  Simply run "xsp2" in this directory and you'll get a list of 
	all the xamls you can startup.

2008-02-22  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* xaml/test-path-group-stretch.xaml: add some stretched paths with
	incomplete size specifiers.

2007-10-24  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* harness/xaml2png.cpp: fill the background with white so we look
	like mopen.  Also, use the MS way of specifying timespecs -
	"100,15" == generate image every 100 milliseconds, up to 15
	images.

2007-10-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* harness/xaml2png.cpp (main): use RUNTIME_INIT_AUDIO_DISABLE so
	we can screenshot video.

2007-10-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* harness/xaml2png.cpp: fix up a lot of this.  allow timespans to
	be places on the command line after the xaml file + output file
	args, and use the manual time source to move the timemanager to
	those times before dumping pngs.

2007-10-17  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* harness/Makefile.am (xaml2png_LDADD): add MOON_PROG_LIBS.
