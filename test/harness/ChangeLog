2008-06-16  Andrew Jorgensen  <ajorgensen@novell.com>

	* test-runner/HtmlReport.cs: Use index.html rather than index.htm

2008-06-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* test-runner/DbusServices.cs, test-runner/LoggingServer.cs: Don't fail
	  a test run if logging-server.exe is running.

2008-06-10  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* harness.mdp: Updated.

2008-05-29  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* test-runner/Test.cs: When starting up xsp wait a second before
	  continuing with the test.

2008-05-28  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* agviewer/agviewer.cpp: Add hang/infinite loop detection.

2008-05-27  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* test-runner/Driver.cs, test-runner/HtmlReport.cs,
	  test-runner/ConsoleReport.cs, test-runner/TestResult.cs,
	  test-runner/TestRun.cs: Added TestResult.UnexpectedPass.

2008-05-27  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* test-runner/Driver.cs: I lack the knowledge to do this at
	  configure/build time, so lets do it during execution.

2008-05-27  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* test-runner/XmlReport.cs, test-runner/Test.cs,
	  test-runner/ImageCompare.cs, test-runner/HtmlReport.cs,
	  test-runner/EdgeCompare.cs: Dispose of Graphics/Image/Bitmaps when
	  we're done with them.

2008-05-27  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* agviewer/agviewer.cpp: Set the current directory to the directory
	  where each test resides, and only use the -working-dir argument for
	  remote tests. This is necessary since tests may reside in any
	  directory now that we support nested drtlists.

2008-05-26  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* harness.mdp: Updated.

2008-05-24  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* test-runner/Driver.cs: Added support for remote and nested drtlists.

2008-05-24  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* test-runner/Test.cs: Don't load dimensions until we need them. Cuts
	  the time spent running 1 test to a third (from 15 seconds to 5
	  seconds on my machine).

2008-05-24  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* agviewer/agviewer.cpp: Install a signal handler to print stack traces
	  when we crash.

2008-05-23  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* harness.mdp: Updated to give better tooltips.

2008-05-23  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* test-runner/LoggingServer.cs, test-runner/ExternalProcess.cs,
	  test-runner/Driver.cs, test-runner/TestRun.cs,
	  test-runner/TestRunner.cs: Add support for running agviewer with
	  gdb, printing test output from the plugin to stdout as we go (so
	  that it comes in sync with the rest of the debug output), and make
	  SWALLOW_STREAMS configurable with an env-var.
	* test-runner/Test.cs, test-runner/HtmlTest.cs: Add support for remote
	  tests.
	* test-runner/ConsoleReport.cs: Don't print colors when we're running
	  gdb, it confuses gdb badly.

2008-05-23  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* test-runner/ConsoleReport.cs: Print the id of the tests in addition
	  to the name.

2008-05-22  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* harness.mdp: Updated.

2008-05-22  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* test-runner/TestRunner.cs: Remove unneeded line.

2008-05-20  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* shocker/input.cpp: We don't need to open our own display anymore
	since this method is called in the main thread.

2008-05-19  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* shocker/image-capture.cpp: Workaround for TIFFs not being saved
	properly.

2008-05-16  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* test-runner/Test.cs: StopXspIfNeeded: Don't take down the entire
	  process if we can't kill XSP.

2008-05-16  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* harness.mdp: Added.

2008-05-16  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* test-runner/Driver.cs, test-runner/TestRunner.cs: Added -valgrind
	  option to run agviewer with valgrind.

2008-05-15  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* test-runner/ConsoleReport.cs: Add colors to the console output.

2008-05-13  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* masters/test-second-surface-errorMaster.png: Added
	  test-second-surface-error.html.

2008-05-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* test-runner/TestRun.cs:
	* test-runner/TestRunner.cs: Move the test setup into the test
	runner so that tests will still be setup when running in a
	separate server process.

2008-05-05  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* agviewer/agviewer.cpp: Use _call instead of the timeout call so
	we can work on older versions of dbus-glib.

2008-05-02  Andrew Jorgensen  <ajorgensen@novell.com>

	* agviewer/Makefile.am: Missing some headers from dist

2008-05-01  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* test-runner/HtmlTest.cs: We always want an initial
	delay. Default to 500. Otherwise the screenshot happens before the
	result is rendered (happens for a bunch of the current tests).

2008-04-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* test-runner/Driver.cs: Sometimes you want to start a run midway
	through.  I added MOON_DRT_FIXTURE_START so you can specify which
	test the run should start on.

2008-04-30  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* test-runner/ConsoleReport.cs: Now that processing is async we
	can't report test and result separately.

2008-04-29  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* test-runner/EdgeCompare.cs:
	* test-runner/ImageCompare.cs: Dispose bitmaps.

	* test-runner/Test.cs: Add the completed reason as a property.
	* test-runner/TestRunner.cs: Set the completed reason property
	when tests are completed.
	* test-runner/TestRun.cs: Test processing is now done in a
	separate thread, this allows the tests to run while image compares
	are done in the background.  When a test that does animation or
	input or something else that takes a lot of time the processing
	thread can catch up, so there isn't much lag at the end of a test
	run and tests load much faster.

2008-04-29  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* shocker/image-capture.cpp: Use gdk for capturing single
	screenshots, this is done in the main thread, so it's safe, a
	little better performing, and frees us of image magicks memory
	management.
	
2008-04-29  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* agviewer/agviewer.cpp (new_gtk_browser): Remove unused variable.

2008-04-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* test-runner/EdgeCompare.cs: We don't need this blurred images
	anymore.

2008-04-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* agviewer/agviewer.cpp: Clean up test_path strings.

2008-04-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* agviewer/agviewer.cpp: Still need to run a main loop when a test
	isn't supplied.

2008-04-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* agviewer/agviewer.cpp: Allow non absolute paths to be used for
	user supplied test paths.

	* test-runner/TestRunner.cs:
	* test-runner/Driver.cs: Add a new mode that allows the test
	runner to run as a separate service which a user can connect to
	with their own agviewer process.  This makes debugging agviewer
	much easier.

2008-04-28  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* agviewer/agviewer.cpp (main): Gotta loop thru all the args.

2008-04-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* agviewer/agviewer.cpp: Fix running in standalone mode.

2008-04-28  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* shocker/input.cpp: When we are shutdown make sure down keys are
	sent an up, otherwise the keyboard ends in a weird state.
	* shocker/shocker.cpp|h: Cleanup the providers when shutdown is
	signalled, not the image capture provider though, since that might
	still be working.
	
2008-04-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* agviewer/agviewer.cpp: Don't use escape for quitting a test
	anymore.  Use CTRL-C, also add CTRL-N to move to the next test.

2008-04-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* test-runner/Driver.cs: Make sure ignored tests get added to the
	report.  We need to add them separately now, because the list of
	tests passed to the runner are only tests that will be run.
	* test-runner/TestRun.cs: Modernize!

2008-04-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* agviewer/agviewer.cpp: Don't start or stop the main loop if
	there are no tests to run.

2008-04-25  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* test-runner/HtmlTest.cs, test-runner/html_template.html: Spaces->tabs
	  and indent correctly.

2008-04-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* agviewer/agviewer.cpp: Fix the error message.

2008-04-25  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* test-runner/Makefile.am: Fix logging-server.exe.

2008-04-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* test-runner/ExternalProcess.cs: For now don't capture
	stdout/stderr, should make debugging a little easier.

2008-04-24  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	- A single agviewer process is now used, when it completes a test,
	it get's the next test from the test-runner.  If the agviewer
	process crashes the test runner will start a new one.
	- Instead of shutting down after each test we send a message to
	the agviewer via dbus, which cleans up and sends the testcompleted
	message up to the runner.
	
2008-04-22  Larry Ewing  <lewing@novell.com>

	* agviewer/agviewer.cpp: fix typo in include.

2008-04-22  Larry Ewing  <lewing@novell.com>

	* agviewer/agviewer.cpp (new_gtk_browser): changes to work against
	newer gtkmozembed versions.

	* shocker/image-capture.cpp (acquire_screenshot): add a probably
	pointless argument to capture in the hope of speeding it up a
	little.

	* shocker/input.cpp: add a disabled alternate version of MoveMouse
	that lets MouseInput pass.

2008-04-21  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* test-runner/HtmlTest.cs: Updated to change
	http://localhost/test/jtr.js to jtr.js. Updated to reflect changes
	made to the test input files.

2008-04-17  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* masters/test-yuv-converterMaster.png: Added yuv converter test,
	  currently fails with our own yuv converter, succeeds with ffmpeg's.

2008-04-17  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* masters/test-canvas-no-sizeMaster.png: Added (currently failing) test
	  with a MediaElement within a Canvas which doesn't have width/height
	  set.

2008-04-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* test-runner/XamlTest.cs: Use a relative path for the path to the xaml file
	  in the html file.
	* test-runner/html_template.html: Make sure we call Connect on the test
	  plugin before using it.

2008-04-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com>

	  all the standalone logging.

2008-04-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* test-runner/HtmlTest.cs: Use relative path for the snapshots. Makes it
	  possible to use the generated html file for creating baselines on SL.
	* test-runner/html_template.html: Some fixes to be compatible with IE/MS'
	  test plugin: pass document.name to SignalShutdown and create the
	  testplugin using a object tag on IE.

2008-04-11  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* shocker/shutdown-manager.cpp: Add a MOONLIGHT_SHOCKER_DONT_DIE flag which,
	  if is set to anything, will prevent the plugin from shutting down the
	  browser.

2008-04-09  Andrew Jorgensen  <ajorgensen@novell.com>
