	* Makefile.am: In order for building where builddir != srcdir to
	work, we need to reference the docs directory as '$(srcdir)/docs/'
	and not just 'docs/'

2007-10-10  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* gtk.cs: Use the XamlLoader in the LoadFile overload as well. 
	Set the surface of the domain for the XamlLoader.

2007-10-09  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* gtk.cs: Use the XamlLoader in agclr.

2007-10-08  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* gtk.cs: Use platform invokes in agmono instead of declaring them
	again. Added a Resize method to resize the surface. Added a LoadXaml
	to load a xaml string. Fixed LoadFile to work again.

2007-09-26  Andrew Jorgensen  <ajorgensen@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add $(DESTDIR) to gacutil command for rpm packaging

2007-08-20  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ManagedDownloader.cs: fix this the right way, by keeping the
	local file case, just putting it in the Download delegate.

2007-08-20  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* ManagedDownloader.cs: remove the special case for files - it
	breaks the async semantics of the downloader class, and keeps
	mopen from working with monotone.

2007-07-16  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* ManagedDownloader.cs: Do not use the auto_reset event after the
	finished callback, because the downloader might just trigger a new
	download and we would have pending events in the queue that are
	never executed.    Fixes loop downloaded crash.

2007-07-06  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* Makefile: add support for uploading the docs to the server.

	* gtk.cs: Eliminate traces of get_response_func, this is now
	handled in the C++ runtime.

2007-07-04  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* ManagedDownloader.cs: Do not go the expensive route if we are
	getting a file:// uri, just get directly from the file system.

2007-07-03  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* ManagedDownloader.cs: Adapt to the new downloading framework
	that requires us to notify with a filename where the results have
	been placed. 

	(Download): Now places the file in a temporary file.   The TODO
	file has been updated with thoughts on how to cache this.

	(Start): Special case for files in the local file system, notify
	the downloader immediately of the transfer being finished.
	
	(dowloader_notify_error, downloader_notify_finished): new
	pinvokes, used to notify of completion and errors.

	* mopen.cs: When --desklet difine also --transparent.

2007-06-25  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* mopen.cs: Use XRoot and YRoot instead of X and Y in drag-and-drop event.

2007-06-25  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* mopen.cs: Add mouse drag-and-drop event.

2007-06-25  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* mopen.cs: Fix mopen crash when canvas size is not specified. We should
	have a better stuff for this, just get it working right now.

2007-06-25  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* mopen.cs: Use cavas size for silver and window size.

2007-06-25  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* mopen.cs: Add support for "--desklet" option, it removes window decoration
	and will add some other desklet related stuff. Also add "--help"
